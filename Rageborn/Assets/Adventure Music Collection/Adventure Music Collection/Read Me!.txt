Hi there!

Thank you so much for purchasing the Adventure Music Collection!!

I am so excited to have my music in your games.  Bringing music and emotion to games brings me great joy.  I would LOVE to see your game when you're finished, so please
shoot me an email if you don't mind so I can see the music in action.  

My composer email is: dk.compose@gmail.com

If you have any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to reach out.


Finally, if you are interested in purchasing custom music for a future game (or current one) I have a website where you can get a quick and easy quote for music that will be 
exclusive to your game!  

My website is:

dkcompose.com


Finally, if you love the music a review and rating would be hugely appreciated.  Don't think the music pack is worth 5 stars?  Email me and let me know how I can improve.


Happy Coding!!!
